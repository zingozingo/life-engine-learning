# Packing Skill

Generate personalized packing lists based on destination, weather, duration, and planned activities. This skill uses pure reasoning — no API calls needed.

## Information to Gather

Before generating a packing list, consider:
1. **Destination**: Climate, culture, urban vs. rural
2. **Duration**: Number of days
3. **Weather**: Current or expected conditions (use weather skill if needed)
4. **Activities**: Business, beach, hiking, city exploration, etc.
5. **Accommodation**: Hotel (amenities provided) vs. camping (self-sufficient)

## Packing List Categories

Organize recommendations into these sections:

### 📋 Documents & Essentials
- Passport, ID, visa documents
- Travel insurance info
- Copies of reservations
- Credit cards, local currency

### 👕 Clothing
Base on weather and activities:
- **Warm weather**: Light layers, breathable fabrics
- **Cold weather**: Layering system (base, mid, outer)
- **Business**: Professional attire, wrinkle-resistant
- **Beach**: Swimwear, cover-ups, sandals
- **Hiking**: Moisture-wicking, sturdy shoes

Rule of thumb: Pack for 5-7 days max, plan to do laundry for longer trips.

### 🧴 Toiletries
- Travel-size containers (TSA 3-1-1 compliant for carry-on)
- Sunscreen, medications, first aid basics
- Destination-specific: insect repellent, altitude sickness meds

### 🔌 Electronics
- Phone, charger, power bank
- Adapters for destination (US, EU, UK, universal)
- Camera, e-reader if desired

### 🎒 Miscellaneous
- Reusable water bottle, snacks
- Day bag for excursions
- Travel pillow, eye mask for flights
- Laundry bag for dirty clothes
